FILES:
README - This file.
Makefile - makefile.
PriorityQueue.h - Class that represents the priority queue specified in the 
	          exercise. Wraps 3 standard library lists and provides a queue 
                  interface.
Thread.h -        Class that represents a thread. Contains all the information 
                  required by a given thread as specified in the exercise. 
Scheduler.h -     Class that implements a specialized 3-priority Round Robin
                  algorithm as per the requirements. It handles all the flow
                  of the program including spawning, resuming, suspending
                  and terminating threads, handling the timer intervals etc.
ThreadUtils.h -   Utility class. Contains utility constants & enums.

PriorityQueue.cpp - Implementation of PriorityQueue.h.
Thread.cpp -        Implementation of Thread.h.
Scheduler.cpp -     Implementation of Scheduler.h.
uthreads.cpp -      Implementation of uthreads.h.

REMARKS:

ANSWERS:

Task1: 

        Round Robin pros:
		1. Every thread gets an equal chance to run.
		2. Each thread is guaranteed to run at least once.
	Round Robin cons:
		1. All threads are born equal, no "high" priority for anyone.
	Priority Queue pros:
		1. Lets you specify a level of importance for each thread.
	Priority Queue cons:
		1. A thread can become starved if its' priority is low 
		   compared to other important threads that continuously run

Task2:

    After installing a program, a message pops up "Press any key to continue".
